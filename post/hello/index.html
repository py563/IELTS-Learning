It got extra ammunition, who uses pen and paper these days to write. We are all slaves to spell checkers, Grammarly, and other smart writing tools. While I scored 8 or more in the other sections and scored 6.5 in writing.</p><p>I prepared a list that needs to be done before giving IELTS yet again. So, after a few life lessons and the journey across the world, I took the IELTS in India. I knew that paper would not do me good, I scheduled a computer-based test.</p><p>Unlike last time, As I finished each section faster to revise, practice spelling words, and noted down some insightful words. I finished the writing section ahead of schedule and cross-referenced it with the tenets taught by the learning series on the blog.</p><p>I could see substantial improvement from the earlier test. But the examiner had other thoughts for the writing section, I scored 9 in reading and 8.5 in listening. To improve writing skills and to share the learning series with other aspirants, I started this blog.</p><p>Please do subscribe to get more reviews of learning series and lesson plans to score a great band in IELTS.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/post/learn-english-australia-plus/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
