The brief unemployment consumed the expiring student work permit like a symbiote, it then shapeshifted as the visa issues. I was also fascinated to design an artificially intelligent travel platform. So, I had to take the IELTS test in Boston, MA. In the following posts, you will understand my choices of words, the writing style, and the cohesion as an author. Spelling was never the strong suit; it came with all guns blazing at me in the paper-based writing section. It got extra ammunition, who uses pen and paper these days to write. We are all slaves to spell checkers, Grammarly, and other smart writing tools. While I scored 8 or more in the other sections and scored 6.5 in writing. I prepared a list that needs to be done before giving IELTS yet again. So, after a few life lessons and the journey across the world, I took the IELTS in India. I knew that paper would not do me good, I scheduled a computer-based test. Unlike last time, As I finished each section faster to revise, practice spelling words, and noted down some insightful words. I finished the writing section ahead of schedule and cross-referenced it with the tenets taught by the learning series on the blog. I could see substantial improvement from the earlier test. But the examiner had other thoughts for the writing section, I scored 9 in reading and 8.5 in listening. To improve writing skills and to share the learning series with other aspirants, I started this blog.
