Who can use and how can it be used We post reviews of various resources for Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking sections in IELTS. All the content is readily available and without signing up for any subscriptions.
We recommend the readers to only use the reviewed notes and video series for preparing to IELTS test and not redistribute it.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://ielts.awashedupnerd.in/page/showcase/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ielts.awashedupnerd.in/page/showcase/</guid><description>The team admires these presenters and organizations, who hosted the invaluable IELTS learning video series, lessons, and resources on the web to students as free content.
