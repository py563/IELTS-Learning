## Requirements

Minimal computer knowledge required to run the scripts.

For detailed information on how to run python based scripts please refer to the repository [Wiki](https://github.com/py563/Learning_Series_IELTS/wiki  "Software Requirements"). Running the scripts would most likely download corresponding pratice activities and study notes which are publicily available but not the videos.
