## When did we start

When I took the IELTS in April 2018, I curated the collection of IELTS preparation video series, resources (materials and notes) and practice activities.

## Who can use and how can it be used

We post reviews of various resources for Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking sections in IELTS. All the content is readily available and without signing up for any subscriptions.

We recommend the readers to only use the reviewed notes and video series for preparing to IELTS test and not redistribute it.

The author for the post does not hold any copyrights for the recommended content, so please strictly adhere to the content owner's policies. For educational purposes, please contact content owners before doing any lesson plans for your students.

## Status

All reviewed contents links are working as of {{ .Lastmod }}.
